+- update docs to reflect permanent option
+- add options to turn different hooks on/off
+- update docs to reflect update/One/Many option
+- add tests for permanent flag
- notify rickogden/mongoose-slug-generator about group update bug (he will need to extend watcher list)
	- when we move doc with counted slug to another group with same docs - slug not updated
	- when we move doc with shortId slug to another group with same docs - slug should not change(in most cases)
+- test updates without _id
+- check if there is a chance to generate same shortId as already exists
- look into findOneAndUpdate hooks
